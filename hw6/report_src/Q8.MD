Order of O(N * (N * D + NlogN)). For each of x1,..., xN values in X_tst, we get the distance for each D for each x in X_trn (N * (N * D)). Per x in X_tst, we must also sort the distances to get K nearest neighbor and select majority class, giving rise to (N * ((N * D) + NlogN + K + K)), but since K is usally much smaller than N, we can abstract it to the order mentioned above.
